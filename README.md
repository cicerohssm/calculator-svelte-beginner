# calculator-svelte-beginner

Calculator developed in a fast and practical Svelte course at Cod3r.com.br. Svelte is a JavaScript compiler that delivers pure JavaScript or Vanilla JS, does not work with Virtual DOM, helps write less code, uses the creation of constants and variables to help you have reactive content, and has a simple project creation process. The course at Cod3r teaches Svelte in a very objective way, and the calculator application is one of the projects covered in the course.
